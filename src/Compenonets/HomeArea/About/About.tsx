      <br />
      <p>I am a software engineer with a passion for creating innovative solutions that solve real-world problems. My expertise lies in web development, database management, and software architecture design.

      </p>
      <br />
      <p>During my time at John Bryce college, I had the opportunity to work on a coupon system project that allowed businesses to create and distribute digital coupons to their customers. The system was designed to be easy to use, secure, and customizable, providing businesses with a powerful tool to attract new customers and retain existing ones.

      </p>
      <br />
      <p>As the lead developer on the project, I was responsible for overseeing the development process, ensuring that the code was clean and well-documented, and testing the system thoroughly to ensure its reliability and functionality. I worked closely with a team of designers and developers to create a user-friendly interface and integrate the system with various e-commerce platforms.

      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Throughout the project, I learned a great deal about project management, team collaboration, and software engineering best practices. I also gained valuable experience in working with clients to understand their needs and develop solutions that meet their requirements.

      </p>
      <br />
      <p>In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal projects and learning about new technologies. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer, and I am excited to see what the future holds.
